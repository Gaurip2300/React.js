## JSX, Functional & Class Components  
Explore the building blocks of React applications:  
- JSX: Writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.  
- Functional Components: Simpler, stateless components.  
- Class Components: Stateful components using class syntax.  

---

## Props, State, and Hooks  
Manage data and reactivity in React:  
- `Props`: Passing data between components.  
- `State`: Managing component-specific data.  
- Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and others for functional components.  

---

## Event Handling and Conditional Rendering  
React-specific patterns for interactivity:  
- Event Handling: Using Reactâ€™s synthetic events (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.).  
- Conditional Rendering: Displaying components or elements based on conditions.  

---

## Component Lifecycle Methods  
Understand the lifecycle of class components:  
- Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting phases.  
- Key lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, etc.  

---

## React Router  
Routing concepts for single-page applications:  
- Nested Routing: Organizing routes hierarchically.  
- Protected Routes: Securing sensitive routes based on authentication.  

---

## Redux Toolkit  
Simplify state management with Redux Toolkit:  
- Core concepts: Actions, Reducers, Store, Middleware.  
- `createSlice` for concise and readable reducers.  

---

## Context API and Redux Comparison  
Alternative approaches to state management:  
- Context API: Sharing state without passing props deeply.  
- Key differences and when to use Context API vs Redux.  

---

## Performance Optimization  
Improve React app performance:  
- `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
- Lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`.  

---

## Forms  
Learn to manage form inputs effectively:  
- Controlled Components: Handling form state in React.  
- Uncontrolled Components: Using refs to access DOM elements.  

---

## Error Boundaries  
Handle rendering errors gracefully:  
- Creating error boundaries using `componentDidCatch`.  
- Best practices for error recovery in React apps.  

---

## Dynamic Features and Reusable Components  
Build versatile components and features:  
- Dynamic forms: Generate forms based on configuration.  
- Pagination: Managing large datasets.  
- Filtering lists: Implementing search or filter functionality.  
- Reusable components: Building modals, buttons, dropdowns, and more.
